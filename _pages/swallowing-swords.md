title: Swallowing Swords
chapter: Chapter 2
---

I spent a good decade swallowing swords. Long swords, short swords, scimitars, daggers. Some were sharp and made me bleed, while others were blunt and hurt in different ways. But regardless of design, they all had one thing in common: they never came out. In time these swords slowly began to rust and rot away at my insides.

What I mean is that I took great pain in on myself to protect the person responsible for delivering it in the first place. Even when they had done me a great deal of harm. In my case, the swords were humiliation and degradation. The assailant was primarily my father and to a lesser extent, my mother and sister. But things were complicated. My family dynamic was fragile, emotionally and financially. When I plunged into the depths of depression and soared towards the heights of anxiety, and my behaviour subsequently changed, I became all too aware of the strain that this caused. Not wanting to create more, I kept things to myself and disappeared. But it was a balancing act that didn’t favour me.

Swallowing swords is the most selfless thing a person can do. What makes it particularly sad is that on the surface, it comes across as an act of total selfishness.

So much of my sword-swallowing can be traced back to a sense of guilt. I was shamed by my old man and then guilted into accepting it by my mother. As a result, I felt a deep disdain and resentment towards them. Wanting to lash out because they treated me so poorly, but restrained because they were my ‘loving family’.

The guilt I experienced was compounded because my old man loved me. This was a line my mother loved to throw my way. Hearing it was like catching an anchor. It debased everything that I felt and invalidated me as a person. My pain didn’t come into contention with his well-meaning parenting, even if I wanted to die.

‘Dear old dad, he loves you.’

‘Greatest bloke, you can’t be angry at him.’

‘He’s just joking.’

But when can I say?

'I wish I hadn't woken up’

‘I wish I was dead'

'Every time you walk in the door I feel like cutting my wrists'.

Adding to the confusion was that everything seemed fine from the outside, so an outcry made no sense. What was worse is that my old man carried himself forever as our saviour, walking as if everything was fine.

> I’m eleven years old when he pulls me aside for the first time. It’s a birthday party, our sun-filled garden is flooded with laughter. My old man looks straight down at me with bloodshot eyes. His voice is guarded by a clenched jaw and gritted teeth, but the words spit out.
> ‘You are disgusting. What are you happy about?’
> My eyes drop to memorise the patch of grass he’s standing on. The sound fades.
> The smile runs from my face.

People thought my old man was a legend and an ideal parent. I thought this during my years of confusion. But it was not the case. Deep down the man was conniving, calculated, targeting others to hide his own insecurities. His children. Me.

He was a fantastic parent.

Identifying that I was swallowing swords was difficult in itself. For a long time I didn't even realise what I was doing. I was protecting and defending my family despite describing great suffering. It was obsessive and reeked of confusion and guilt.

When I was deep in the mindfuck as a kid I didn't know up from down, left from right. The only guidance I had came from my emotions and they acted as my compass. Each time I checked in they pointed directly at my old man. But it was confusing. My loving family kept telling me how great he was, so I couldn't even figure out who the bad guys were.

The only thing I knew for certain is that I was fucked in the head.
