I was trapped and I couldn't even scream.

The situation that I found myself in was hopeless. The mere presence of my family triggered an anxiety so terrible that I couldn't function. I couldn't escape because I was stuck at home and unable to work. The nightmare got scarier because those around me were oblivious to my suffering. I was navigating around suicidal thoughts and a death wish that grew by the week.

There were two options. And the latter was off the table. One of my greatest fears was the thought of my old man taking to the podium to deliver my eulogy the following week. Confused, tears streaming down his face.

So I was stuck.

The world of my family was a scary place because our confidence had been taken away. The only safe thing to do was hide. But to hide meant to live forever in the belly of the beast.

Her mouth closes and her chin sinks low towards her chest. Like she’s just swallowed something horrible." %}

Having no visible scars meant I couldn't prove anything, even to myself. All I had was the way I felt. If my old man had smacked me around then at least I would have learnt to take a punch, but the coward couldn't even give me that.

Living at home meant drowning in guilt but I couldn't leave.

Pressure from my parents weighed me down. There was an innocent questioning of why their son wasn’t moving forward in life and a silent expectation that came with their sacrifice.

Despite sharing the same shackles, those around me were unable to recognise how controlling he was. My sister forever his doting daughter, my mother his loving wife. Guilt spread through my body like a poison whenever they whispered in my ear how much he loved me. When I was pulled aside and encouraged to patch things up with him. Or when they pointed out how stressed he was.

Pressure also came internally. No one knew better than me that I had to escape. But it felt impossible. I was raised to feel pathetic; anguish was the only comfort I knew.

I didn't have a pot to piss in let alone a pan to shit in. And even if I did find enough money to move out, I still lacked the emotional currency to stand on my own two feet.

Concern for my family was a huge burden. I was worried about the impact of my behaviour on them. I could sense their anxiety from tiptoes on creaking floorboards, their whispers.

If I could just get a shitty job and move out then maybe I could escape. But even that was a fantasy. I had a hard time getting out of bed in the morning, let alone walking out the front door.

My sleep was absolute rat shit too. Most of the time I'd wake up feeling ready for bed. On the off days when my family weren't home it felt like Christmas, albeit a lonely one.

In time I found myself waking up to suicidal thoughts. I became accustomed to the monotony of being angry and sad.

The joylessness of this constant was deflating and made my existence feel desolate. Nothing positive existed. It meant that the bad things became even worse as there was nothing good to balance them out.  
So that was my shituation. It wasn't a simple case of a kid not getting on with his old man so he moves out when he turns 18. I was in hell trying to put out a fire so I could crawl back into life.
A life I wasn't even sure I could handle living.
